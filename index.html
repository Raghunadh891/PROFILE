		<h2>HTML Basics</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Every html page should start from &lt;!doctype html&gt; to make the browser know that it is an html file.</li> 
			<br>
			<li>Then use &lt;html&gt; tag to continue further. Now if I have not used the &lt; and &gt; symbols directly, because if I had done, the browser would think that was a tag and would not interpret because there was no such tag or element. So I used &lt; to print &lt; and &gt; to print &gt;. I think it's cool that it follows the logic.</li>

		<h2>Sorting Items in a List</h2>
		I can sort multiple items in 2 ways in a list:
		<h2>A mobile phone consists of:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#camera">camera</a></li>
			<li><a href="#display">display</a></li>
			<li><a href="#battery">battery</a></li>
			<li><a href="#motherboard">motherboard</a></li>
			<li><a href="#sensors">sensors</a></li>
			<li><a href="#processor">processor</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>And many more things are combined together to form a mobile phone.</p>
		<p>The above was an unorganized list.</p>

		<h2>A mobile phone consists of:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li><a href="#camera">camera</a></li>
			<li><a href="#display">display</a></li>
			<li><a href="#battery">battery</a></li>
			<li><a href="#motherboard">motherboard</a></li>
			<li><a href="#sensors">sensors</a></li>
			<li><a href="#processor">processor</a></li>
		</ol>
		<p>And many more things are combined together to form a mobile phone.</p>
		<p>The above was an organized list.</p>

		<p>There is not much difference in both, but the automatic numbering in the organized list.</p>

	<!-- Sections for each item -->
	<div class="section" id="camera">
		<h3><a href="#top">Camera</a></h3> <!-- Link to top -->
		<p>A camera is a device that captures and records visual images, allowing users to immortalize moments and scenes in a tangible format. It works by focusing light through a lens onto a light-sensitive surface, such as film or a digital sensor. This process creates an image that can be stored, printed, or shared digitally. Cameras enable users to capture a wide range of subjects, from portraits and landscapes to action shots and close-ups, making them invaluable tools for both personal memories and professional photography. Additionally, modern cameras come equipped with various features and settings that enhance image quality, such as autofocus, image stabilization, and different shooting modes, providing users with the flexibility to express their creativity.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section" id="display">
		<h3><a href="#top">Display</a></h3> <!-- Link to top -->
		<p>A display is a screen that showcases visual content and allows users to interact with their devices. In mobile phones, the display serves as the primary interface for accessing applications, viewing images, watching videos, and browsing the internet. It typically uses technologies such as LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) or OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) to produce vibrant colors and sharp images. Displays vary in size, resolution, and responsiveness, with higher resolutions providing clearer and more detailed visuals. Touchscreen capabilities enable users to navigate and control their devices effortlessly, enhancing the overall user experience. Additionally, features like adaptive brightness and blue light filters contribute to user comfort and visibility in different lighting conditions.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section" id="battery">
		<h3><a href="#top">Battery</a></h3> <!-- Link to top -->
		<p>A battery is a crucial component of mobile devices, providing the necessary power to operate the phone and its features. It stores electrical energy in chemical form and releases it to power the device's functions, from making calls to running apps and playing media. Modern smartphones typically use lithium-ion batteries, known for their high energy density and longevity. Battery life is influenced by various factors, including usage patterns, screen brightness, and background applications. Many devices also feature fast charging and wireless charging capabilities, allowing users to quickly replenish battery power, ensuring that their phones remain functional throughout the day.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section" id="motherboard">
		<h3><a href="#top">Motherboard</a></h3> <!-- Link to top -->
		<p>The motherboard is the main circuit board in a mobile phone, serving as the central hub that connects and communicates with all other components. It houses critical hardware, including the processor, memory, storage, and various controllers, facilitating the flow of data between these elements. The motherboard also includes slots for additional components, such as SIM cards and expansion modules, and interfaces for external connections like USB ports and audio jacks. Its design and architecture significantly impact the device's performance, efficiency, and overall capabilities. As the backbone of the smartphone, the motherboard plays a vital role in ensuring that all features work harmoniously, providing users with a seamless experience.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section" id="sensors">
		<h3><a href="#top">Sensors</a></h3> <!-- Link to top -->
		<p>Sensors in mobile phones play a vital role in enhancing functionality and user experience. They detect and respond to various environmental factors, enabling features such as automatic screen rotation, GPS navigation, and fitness tracking. Common sensors include accelerometers, which measure movement and orientation; gyroscopes, which detect rotation; and proximity sensors, which turn off the display during calls to save battery. Additional sensors like ambient light sensors adjust screen brightness based on surrounding light conditions, while biometric sensors, such as fingerprint scanners and facial recognition, provide security and convenient access to the device. These sensors work together to create a seamless and intuitive user experience.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section" id="processor">
		<h3><a href="#top">Processor</a></h3> <!-- Link to top -->
		<p>The processor, often referred to as the brain of a mobile phone, is responsible for executing instructions and processing data. It handles everything from running applications and managing system tasks to processing graphics and maintaining connectivity. Modern smartphones typically feature multi-core processors that allow for simultaneous processing of multiple tasks, resulting in improved performance and responsiveness. The processorâ€™s architecture and clock speed influence the overall speed of the device, affecting how smoothly applications run and how quickly tasks are completed. Additionally, integrated graphics processing units (GPUs) enhance visual performance, making the processor essential for gaming, multimedia, and demanding applications.</p>
